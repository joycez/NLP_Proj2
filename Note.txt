1. P(s|f)?

By Bayesian rules, this is calculated by (page 3 in problem_statement.pdf)
	P(s|f) = P(f|s)P(s)/P(f)
and we provide functions to calculate P(f|s) (probFeature) and P(s) (probSense) separately. Multiply them to get what you want.

2. Feature vector?

By now, it's just a simple array of the preceding words and following words.
See documentation in sup_model.py.
