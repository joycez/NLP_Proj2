What I did:
1. Added two functions into 'sup_model.py' at the end
2. Wrote 'Inference.py' to evaluate the model

Current Result:
Accurate: 0
Total: 933
Accuracy: 0.0

See 'TODO' for improvements needed:
1. ***FIRST PRIORITY*** See 'sup_model.py' line 44
2. ***BUG HERE*** See 'sup_model.py' line 68
3. See 'sup_preprocessing.py' line 19
4. See 'sup_model.py' line 52
