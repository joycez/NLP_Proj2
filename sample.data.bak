capital.n | 1 | Another fight is brewing between Congress and the Bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit . In a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee , the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office , which both are arms of Congress , advised the new S&L bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working %% capital %% through debt issued from an agency that would n't be counted on the federal budget . Officials of the Resolution Trust Corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout . Instead , the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office said , the RTC should consider using Treasury debt , which is less expensive and subject to oversight by Congress .
capital.n | 1 | Instead , the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office said , the RTC should consider using Treasury debt , which is less expensive and subject to oversight by Congress . The spending could be exempted from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the Gramm-Rudman budget law . The RTC has projected that it will require between $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion in temporary working %% capital %% . The borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold . The new S&L law allows the RTC to issue notes for as much as 85 % of the value of the assets it holds .
capital.n | 1 | In the meantime , the agency must raise cash to maintain assets , such as real estate , until they can be sold . Then the short-term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets . David Mullins , assistant secretary of the Treasury , said that the working %% capital %% is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout , by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets , then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions . He said it has n't yet been determined how the RTC will raise the cash , but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget , because it would `` distort '' the budget process by requiring either exemptions from Gramm-Rudman or big increases in the budget deficit . But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital , he said .

capital.n | 1 | The banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business . Meanwhile , the securities companies -- most of them smaller than the banks -- are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that would n't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks . Nomura , the world 's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field , and Industrial Bank of Japan , Japan 's most innovative and aggressive bank in %% capital %% markets abroad , captain the opposing sides . And their suspicions of each other run deep . In the past year , both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses .

This quarter 's loss includes pretax charges of $ 4.9 million on the proposed discontinuation of the company 's troubled British subsidiary , and $ 3.7 million of other write-offs the company said were non-recurring and principally related to inventory , publishing advances and pre-publication costs . The publishing concern said it retained the investment banking firm of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Inc. to act as its financial adviser , assisting in the evaluation of various financial and strategic alternatives , including debt refinancing , raising %% capital %% , recapitalization , a merger or sale of the company . The company also retained attorney Martin P. Levin , a director of the company and former head of the Times-Mirror Publishing Group , as an adviser .

The restructuring program is designed to increase the company 's tangible %% capital %% ratio . It includes removing $ 242 million in good will from the books , issuing $ 150 million in preferred stock and commencing an exchange offer for $ 52 million in convertible bonds . During the third quarter , the company charged about $ 46 million against earnings in reducing goodwill , added $ 20 million to its general loan loss reserves and established a $ 30 million reserve for its high-yield bond portfolio .

capital.n | 1 | An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the U.S.S.R. , particularly the Democratic Union , allege that they show `` terroristic tendencies '' and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims . It is possible that , in perpetuating such myths , the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism . Mr. Gorbachev would appear to see his central task , however , as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor , %% capital %% and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo . If he were able to construct a popular and efficient corporatist system , he or his heir would be wellplaced to rein in political opposition , and to re-establish control in Eastern Europe . The weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations -- Mr. Gorbachev is a consummate political leader , perhaps one of the greatest -- but in its economic prescription .
capital.n | 1 | The partnership said it is proposing the change largely because the provisions of its senior notes restrict it from making distributions on its units outstanding . NRM suspended its common distribution in June 1988 and the distribution on its $ 2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units in September . However , unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred are cumulative and would total $ 23 million a year , hurting NRM 's financial flexibility and its ability to raise %% capital %% , NRM said . In following several other oil and gas partnerships that have made the conversion to a corporation in the last year , NRM also noted that tax advantages for partnerships have diminished under new tax laws and said it would save $ 2 million a year in administrative costs from the change . Under the plan , NRM said holders of its common units will receive one share of new common stock in Edisto Resources Corp. for every 14.97 common units owned .
capital.n | 1 | The uncertainty is sending shivers through Brazilian financial markets . The dollar , the best indicator of the country 's mood , has skyrocketed on the parallel market , as has gold . %% Capital %% flight is reported to be strong . The big question is whether the new president will have the strength and the political support in Congress to take steps to cure Brazil 's economic ills . President Jose Sarney , who took office in 1985 when the man picked by an electoral college became critically ill , appears to be simply trying to avoid hyperinflation .

For one of the superstars of glasnost , Vitaly Korotich , editor of the trail-blazing weekly Ogonyok , Friday , Oct. 20 was a somersaulting day that turned from tension to elation . He had been summoned to the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party , after he finished his lunch at the Savoy Hotel , an unlikely prelude to a bureaucratic brow-beating : Eight-foot-tall Rubenesquely naked ladies float on their canvases toward a ceiling teeming with cherubs , all surrounded by gilt laid on with a pastry chef 's trowel and supported by marble corinthian columns whose %% capitals %% are fluting fountains of gold . Why had Mr. Korotich been called ? `` I told my driver , '' he said , `` that he was taking my butt to the Central Committee so they can ...

capital.n | 1 | There 's an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the European Community . It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , which links the major EC currencies . At a June EC summit , Mrs. Thatcher appeared to ease her opposition to full EMS membership , saying Britain would join once its inflation rate fell and the EC liberalized %% capital %% movements . Since then , the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join . Sir Alan assailed the monetary arrangement as `` half-baked '' in an article being published in an American economics journal .
capital.n | 2 | The talks in New York are the first since Bush and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze unveiled proposals in September to scrap existing weapons . Afghan guerrillas bombarded Kabul in a weekend assault that Western diplomats called one of the biggest offensives since the Soviet Union completed a troop withdrawal in February . The rebels also reportedly tightened a blockade on roads leading to the %% capital %% , and government forces shelled a guerrilla-held area in western Afghanistan . Lebanon 's Christian leader convened an emergency meeting of his cabinet after indications that he might dissolve Parliament in an attempt to scuttle an Arab-sponsored peace plan . Gen. Michel Aoun rejected the pact because it fails to provide a timetable for a Syrian troop pullout from Lebanon .
capital.n | 1 | That 's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash , when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled . Market makers , to cut costs , slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders are n't selling . And to protect their reduced %% capital %% investment from eroding further , market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress . On days when prices are tumbling , they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will . In such an environment , market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares .

capital.n | 1 | It was fear of disturbing EMS exchange-rate relationships that caused the Chirac government in France to be timid about cutting tax rates . Edouard Balladur , the finance minister at the time , was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship . The price of attracting %% capital %% -- whether one 's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit . To avoid this deficit Mr. Lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise . This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit .
capital.n | 1 | Little wonder that Mrs. Thatcher 's opponents were so anxious to keep Mr. Lawson in office . It is extraordinary that the British Treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound . The British balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to 40 % , the flow abroad of British %% capital %% slowed , to 50 billion pounds ( $ 79 billion at the current rate ) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986 . This change in the British capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account , a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency . Nigel Lawson was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s .

capital.n | 1 | Profit for its commercial insurance division fell 30 % to $ 59 million , reflecting higher catastrophe losses and the price war in the property\/casualty market for nearly three years . However , Aetna 's employee benefits division , which includes its group health insurance operations , posted a 34 % profit gain to $ 106 million . Third-quarter results included net realized %% capital %% gains of $ 48 million , which included $ 27 million from the sale of Federated Investors in August and a $ 15 million tax credit .

capital.n | 1 | While no doubt agreeing with Mr. Lawson on everything else , Sir Alan is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist , inclined to defend floating rates to the death . To make matters even more confusing , the earlier U.S. experience made clear that Mr. Lawson 's tax cuts would have profound effects on Britain 's international accounts and the value of sterling . They increased the after-tax rate of return and made Britain a far more attractive place to invest , producing sudden %% capital %% inflows . By accounting definitions , this had to produce a sudden trade deficit . As in the U.S. , it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling , that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates , M-Whatever .

In fiscal 1984 , before Mr. Gandhi came to power , only $ 810 million was raised . This year 's biggest issue , $ 570 million of convertible debentures by engineering company Larsen & Toubro Ltd. , is the largest in Indian history .
capital.n | 1 | India 's overregulated businessmen had to be persuaded , but they have started to think big . Some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first fruits of Mr. Gandhi 's policy , and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past . The industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the %% capital %% market , which is a far cheaper source of funds than government-controlled banks , where interest rates for prime borrowers are around 16 % . The second factor spurring mega-issues is political . Mr. Gandhi has called general elections for November , and many businessmen fear that he and his Congress ( I ) Party will lose .
capital.n | 1 | `` I do n't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market , '' says Mr. Patel , `` only a sagging tendency . '' Says M.J. Pherwani , chairman of the Unit Trust of India : The `` markets are headed for growth unheard of and unseen before . '' But with growth come growing pains , and never has this been clearer on the Indian %% capital %% market than now . In the past , the government controlled the markets indirectly , through its tight grip on industry itself . Various ministries decided the products businessmen could produce and how much ; and government-owned banks controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether companies came through on promised plans .
capital.n | 1 | American Pioneer Inc. said it agreed in principle to sell its American Pioneer Life Insurance Co. subsidiary to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. 's HBJ Insurance Cos. for $ 27 million . American Pioneer , parent of American Pioneer Savings Bank , said the sale will add %% capital %% and reduce the level of investments in subsidiaries for the thrift holding company . Recently , the boards of both the parent company and the thrift also voted to suspend dividends on preferred shares of both companies and convert all preferred into common shares . The company said the move was necessary to meet capital requirements .

Recently , the boards of both the parent company and the thrift also voted to suspend dividends on preferred shares of both companies and convert all preferred into common shares .

In the second quarter , American Pioneer reported a loss of $ 7.3 million , compared with net income of $ 1.1 million a year earlier .
capital.n | 1 | Continued strength in the dollar was cited as one reason the trade position may deteriorate . The Treasury 's report , which is required annually by a provision of the 1988 trade act , again took South Korea to task for its exchange-rate policies . `` We believe that there have continued to be indications of exchange-rate ` manipulation ' '' during the past six months , it said , citing the lack of market forces in South Korea 's exchange-rate system and the use of %% capital %% and interest-rate controls to manipulate exchange rates . The Treasury expressed pleasure , however , with the government of Taiwan , which was cited for exchange-rate manipulation in last year 's report . The Treasury said Taiwan has liberalized its exchange rate system in the past year .
capital.n | 1 | The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government , analysts say . Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November , Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes . But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy , cut costs , increase %% capital %% and build up new areas of business . `` We 've got a lot to do , '' he acknowledged . `` We 've got to move quickly . ''
capital.n | 1 | Now it says it 'll trim another 1,200 jobs over the next three to four years . The bank employs 8,000 people in Spain and 2,000 abroad . To strengthen its %% capital %% base , Banco Exterior this year issued $ 105 million in subordinated debt , launched two rights issues and sold stock held in its treasury to small investors . The bank is now aggressively marketing retail services at its domestic branches . Last year 's drop in export credit was partially offset by a 15 % surge in lending to individuals and small and medium-sized companies .
capital.n | 1 | Banco Exterior was one of the last banks to create a brokerage house before the four Spanish stock exchanges underwent sweeping changes in July . The late start may be a handicap for the bank as Spain continues to open up its market to foreign competition . But Mr. Luzon contends that the experienced team he brought with him from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya , where he was formerly director general , will whip the bank 's %% capital %% market division into shape by the end of 1992 . The bank also says it 'll use its international network to channel investment from London , Frankfurt , Zurich and Paris into the Spanish stock exchanges .

The debentures are convertible into common stock at $ 25 a share , representing a 24 % conversion premium over Thursday 's closing price .

'' Kellogg is based in Battle Creek , Mich. , a city that calls itself the breakfast %% capital %% of the world . Another analyst , John C. Maxwell Jr. of Wheat , First Securities in Richmond , Va. , recently went to a `` sell '' recommendation on Kellogg stock , which closed Friday at $ 71.75 , down 75 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . `` I do n't think Kellogg can get back to 40 % this year , '' he said .
capital.n | 1 | Government officials were expected to combine Waertsilae Marine with two other struggling firms , and thus ensure Finland 's survival as a shipbuilding nation . The government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was thwarted when the parent Waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute . After the restructuring of Waertsilae Marine and bolstered by state loan guarantees , two big bank creditors , Union Bank of Finland and state-controlled Postipankki , resumed lending the shipyard working %% capital %% . But the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been misled about the shipyard 's actual financial condition , and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn . People familiar with Monday 's board meeting said it was the state 's refusal to explicitly reaffirm the credit guarantees that led Union Bank and Postipankki to halt lending to Waertsilae Marine .
capital.n | 1 | But opposition legislators and others calling for help for South Korea 's renters say the proposed changes do n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary people to buy a home . Some want lower limits on house sizes ; others insist on progressively higher taxation for larger homes and lots . The Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice , a public-interest group leading the charge for radical reform , wants restrictions on landholdings , high taxation of %% capital %% gains , and drastic revamping of the value-assessment system on which property taxes are based . But others , large landowners , real-estate developers and business leaders , say the government 's proposals are intolerable . Led by the Federation of Korean Industries , the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties .
capital.n | 1 | The Ministry of Finance , as a result , has proposed a series of measures that would restrict business investment in real estate even more tightly than restrictions aimed at individuals . Under those measures , financial institutions would be restricted from owning any more real estate than they need for their business operations . Banks , investment and credit firms would be permitted to own land equivalent in value to 50 % of their %% capital %% -- currently the proportion is 75 % . The maximum allowable property holdings for insurance companies would be reduced to 10 % of their total asset value , down from 15 % currently . But Mrs. Park acknowledges that even if the policies work to slow or stop speculation , apartment prices are unlikely to go down .
capital.n | 1 | And Mario Gabelli , another star in the investing world , says , `` My gut says the negatives of futures and synthetics far outweigh the benefits . '' Like others , Mr. Gabelli says that if futures cause investors to lose confidence in stocks , they will move away from stocks -- as many have already done . And those who remain , he says `` will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of %% capital %% to companies . '' Essentially , the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps . One group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility ; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital .

'' Essentially , the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps . One group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility ; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market 's basic function of raising %% capital %% . `` Before futures , '' says New York investor Michael Harkins , `` you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing you were buying had any intrinsic value . '' While it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices , traders now routinely check the futures markets in Chicago before they buy or sell stocks .
capital.n | 1 | By contrast , an investor in stocks must put up 50 % in cash . Some critics say futures encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity , rather than as investments in individual businesses . Thus , they say , futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market : to accurately price securities so that %% capital %% and investment flows where it 's needed most . The S&P 500 index futures `` transferred the identity of 500 stocks into one unit - making them a simple commodity to trade , '' says George Kegler , senior vice president at A. Webster Dougherty in Philadelphia . `` It took away the need to know the bad third-quarter report of IBM , for example , '' Mr. Kegler says .
capital.n | 1 | W.R. Grace & Co. said it formed a new horticultural-products company by combining its soil-nutrients and fertilizers business with Sierra Chemical Co. , Milpitas , Calif . Grace , a maker of specialty chemicals that already owned about 30 % of closely held Sierra , said it owns a 49 % stake in the new company . Grace said it did n't invest any additional %% capital %% in the venture , which will be known as Grace-Sierra Horticultural Products Co . The business is expected to have sales of about $ 100 million in 1990 , Grace said . The new company 's product lines will be aimed at nurseries , greenhouses and the lawn and garden industry .
capital.n | 1 | Why do you continually ignore the salubrious effects of indexing the basis of %% capital %% gains for inflation ? Why do you maintain the House-passed capital-gains plan is a `` temporary '' reduction when it is not ? I think the reason is that you are confusing tax `` rates '' with tax `` payments . ''
capital.n | 1 | The monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation : tax rate , times inflation rate , times basis for the gain . Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation , indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the 19.6 % rate without indexation . But in any event -- and this is the important point -- tax `` payments '' on %% capital %% gains will be lower with indexation than under current law , even though the tax `` rate '' is the same under both systems . As you can see , the capital-gains reduction plan adopted by the House would not be temporary , but permanent . I hope that you begin talking about the plan 's permanent and , in my view , most beneficial feature -- indexation .
capital.n | 1 | Rep. Robert K. Dornan ( R. , Calif . ) Washington That the motivation for the two-year reduction to 19.6 % is budgetary does not mean it is not in the public interest . The reduction eases the burden on portfolio changes and frees %% capital %% to seek more productive or more appropriate uses . But what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after 1991 . To argue that this is `` not likely '' to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense .

capital.n | 1 | Cie. de Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier said his board unanimously rejected as too low the $ 1.77 billion bid by Cie. Financiere de Paribas to bring its stake in Navigation Mixte to 66.7 % . At a news conference , Mr. Fournier accused Paribas of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company , whose interests include insurance , banking , tuna canning , sugar and orange juice . The chairman said his board members , including representatives of West German insurance giant Allianz AG and French banks Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale , hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte 's %% capital %% . Mr. Fournier said that as Navigation Mixte chairman , he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business . But sources said he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in Navigation Mixte , which is being traded in London and is to resume trading in Paris Tuesday .
capital.n | 1 | The petition is still pending , but Mr. Fournier downplayed the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the much-larger Paribas . One big question now is the likely role of Mr. Fournier 's allies . Mr. Fournier said the large institutions that hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte 's %% capital %% all strongly support him , but some analysts said they are n't so sure . Allianz , for example , has said in official comments so far that it will remain neutral . Paribas is Allianz 's lead French bank .
capital.n | 1 | Black & Decker rescued Emhart from the takeover bid of Topper Limited Partnership last March by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $ 2.8 billion . The move significantly expanded Black & Decker 's product line , but also significantly increased its debt load . The acquisition boosted Black & Decker 's ratio of debt to total %% capital %% to more than 80 % . Company officials have said they plan to reduce that ratio to less than 50 % over the next 2 1\/2 years . Earlier this year , Black & Decker put three Emhart businesses on the auction block : the information and electronics segment , the Dynapert electrical assembly business and Mallory Capacitors .

capital.n | 1 | The Packwood-Roth proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held . It also would create a new individual retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes , including retirement , medical expenses , first-home purchases and tuition . `` A number of us are not going to touch %% capital %% gains , IRAs or anything else unless it contributes to deficit-reduction , '' said Sen. Charles Robb ( D. , Va. ) , who is one of the 10 to 20 Democrats who the Bush administration believes might favor giving preferential treatment to capital gains . President Bush has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with Democratic senators at the White House . And at a luncheon meeting Tuesday of Democratic senators , there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital-gains tax this year , according to participants .

capital.n | 1 | Today , Sen. Mitchell and other leading Democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to bash the proposal . Estimates requested by Sen. Mitchell from the Congressional Joint Taxation Committee show that the richest 100 taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital-gains differential of $ 13 million each in 1985 , the last year for which figures are available . White House officials acknowledged yesterday that Democrats still are reluctant to publicly express support for the Packwood-Roth %% capital %% gains proposal because they are loath to buck Sen. Mitchell . As a result , the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with Senate Democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut . Democrats asked in this week for discussions with President Bush have suggested ways of `` tinkering '' with the Packwood-Roth proposal , suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back , one official said .

One would force brokerage houses to provide the SEC detailed information about loans made by their holding companies . Such loans often are used to finance leveraged buy-outs , and the agency is worried that a sharp market drop could create %% capital %% problems for the firms . He also backed a rule to require large traders to report transactions on a systematic basis . That information , he argued , is critical to reconstructing sharp market moves , such as the one nearly two weeks ago .

Qintex Australia said it had n't seen the suit and could n't comment .
capital.n | 1 | The National Institutes of Health policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health-care businesses -- or lose their government money . Among other concerns , the agency says researchers with business ties are more likely to falsify findings in order to tout new drugs . As ties between academia and venture %% capital %% have blossomed in recent years , governmental fear of abuse has risen . But the guidelines could `` make it impossible to commercialize research , '' says Kenneth Smith , associate provost and vice president for research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . The NIH is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec. 15 .
capital.n | 1 | Athena eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it . But , says Mr. Bock , `` It was a close call . '' The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization -- and force small companies to waste scarce %% capital %% , entrepreneurs say . If start-ups ca n't have early access to research being conducted at institutions , `` we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research , '' says Ruth Emyanitoff , manager of business development at Applied bioTechnology Inc. , a Cambridge , Mass. , concern . Duplicating research is both costly and time-consuming for a start-up , Ms. Emyanitoff says .

capital.n | 1 | The recent bids for United and American Airlines have led Congress to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements . The House is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block , for up to 50 days , any bid for 15 % or more of a U.S. airline , even a straight cash purchase . Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner , who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his quasi-xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in U.S. carriers , now says the bill would further disturb the jittery %% capital %% markets . Texas Rep. Steve Bartlett , who has 40,000 American Airlines workers in his district , says the bill is `` good politics , but bad law . '' It is ironic that at a time when America 's partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from New Zealand to Ethiopia , so many in Congress favor an incumbent-protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the Soviet airline , Aeroflot .

PWA 's long-term debt and %% capital %% lease obligations rose to C$ 1.24 billion at the end of the second quarter , nearly double the year-earlier figure , reflecting debt absorbed under the Wardair purchase . PWA said it also expects to announce by Tuesday whether it will take delivery of all 17 Airbus 320-200 aircraft it previously ordered . The first five leased units were to be delivered in 1991 .
capital.n | 1 | Regarding your Sept. 28 Politics & Policy column on the party differences over cutting %% capital %% gains or expanding IRAs : Why not compromise now and save the public from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process ? The Republicans maintain that a 30 % capital-gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment , while the Democrats maintain that an increase in the top income-tax rate and expanded IRAs will raise revenue and spur savings . This is a classic example of the old saying , `` The whole is greater than the sum of its parts . ''
capital.n | 1 | It 's ridiculous for a family with taxable income of $ 50,000 to pay the same 28 % incremental tax rate as a family with taxable income of $ 250,000 .

It 's equally ridiculous not to provide a %% capital %% investment or retirement-savings tax incentive . Jeffrey T. Schmidlin
capital.n | 2 | This has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the Iron Curtain and interesting shifts in official American policy toward Moscow . It has also been a week when inside-the-beltway Washington has had a high old time gnawing over ex-President Reagan 's multimillion-dollar junket in Japan . The latter may seem oddly irrelevant , if not downright trivial , given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the nation 's %% capital %% has done nothing to dispel that impression . In fact , however , Mr. Reagan 's casual debasement of the office he so recently held raises issues about which Americans can actually do something . Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal .
capital.n | 1 | The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly , but whether the main reason was dollar intervention , the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment , or the Friday 13 market drop , only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know . Earlier this year , Martin Feldstein , president of the National Bureau of Economic Research , argued forcefully that a government that wants steady , stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies . Trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level , he said , `` would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate %% capital %% formation . '' The more we think about it , the more we suspect Mr. Brady does indeed have enough power where he already is .
capital.n | 1 | There is likely to be a natural division of labor , says Francois Heisbourg , director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , with the U.S. more engaged in strategic issues with the Soviet Union , and Western Europe more involved with specific aid measures for the East . The designation at July 's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the EC Commission as coordinator of Western aid to Poland and Hungary was a first step . In part , this division is dictated by economics : West Germany is a net exporter of %% capital %% while the U.S. is n't . While American aid efforts have been limited by budget problems , yesterday France announced a three-year , four billion French franc ( $ 650 million ) aid plan for Poland . Despite sudden changes in the strategic equation , some Western European leaders , especially British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , remain skeptical about European political and economic unity , and are unlikely to let East-West concerns change their minds .

This charge was partly offset , however , by $ 19 million in pretax %% capital %% gains . ITT also said its consumer finance unit agreed in September to settle a civil suit with the California attorney general over alleged improper lending and sales practices . Anticipating this settlement , the company recorded a pretax charge of $ 24 million during the fourth quarter of 1988 .

On Capitol Hill , though , there does n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair %% capital %% gains and the deficit-reduction bill . Texas Rep.

Prospective bond buyers noted that TW historically has prospered because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and redoing menus . `` We were concerned that they were n't going to generate enough cash for %% capital %% spending and also to pay down debt , '' says a big investor in high-yield debt . DLJ argues that TW could , if necessary , cut capital spending , since half of what it plans to spend is for `` growth , '' rather than maintenance . But investors noted that under the shelved offering , TW would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments .

But investors noted that under the shelved offering , TW would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments . Its calculations for meeting cash charges ignore $ 52 million a year in interest on cash-deferred , or zero-coupon debentures -- which ultimately would have had to be paid .
capital.n | 1 | Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings & Loan Association said it plans to restructure in the wake of a third-quarter loss of $ 7.7 million , or $ 1.01 a share , reflecting an $ 11 million addition to loan-loss reserves . The Portland , Ore. , thrift said the restructuring should help it meet new %% capital %% standards from the Financial Institution Reform , Recovery and Enforcement Act . A year ago , Benjamin Franklin had profit of $ 1.8 million , or 23 cents a share . In over-the-counter trading yesterday , Benjamin Franklin rose 25 cents to $ 4.25 .
capital.n | 1 | Japan is going on a capital-spending binge that could make its trade surpluses even harder to shrink . Its %% capital %% spending is growing at double-digit rates for the second year in a row , and its superefficient producers of everything from cars to computer chips are rushing to expand capacity , modernize factories and develop new products . `` The boom 's so huge , '' says Mitsuru Saito , an economist at Sanwa Research Institute , `` it makes you think of the Golden '60s , '' when Japan developed rapidly . The more factories and robots Japanese manufacturers add , the more they will be able to export , and the less their domestic customers will need to import .
capital.n | 1 | They fear that the boom may be too big for Japan 's or anyone else 's good . `` It 's an explosive cocktail '' thrown at the world , says Kenneth Courtis , senior economist at the Tokyo unit of Deutsche Bank Group . The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging Japanese auto companies to exercise caution in %% capital %% spending . MITI officials hope to avoid yet-another source of trade friction with the U.S. even though export restraints currently limit Japanese car exports to the U.S. . Not everyone is worried , however .
capital.n | 1 | Also participating in the issue was Servifilm Spain Cinematografica S.A . The film producer , owned by Madrid-based financier Jacques Hachuel , received a 5 % stake in the Barcelona-based publishing group . The cash injection boosted Zeta 's %% capital %% more than four-fold , to 8.47 billion pesetas from 1.82 billion pesetas , greatly enhancing the group 's ability to make investments , Zeta officials said . Following its failure last month to win a license for one of Spain 's first three private television stations , Zeta is seeking investment opportunities in communications and publishing . With annual sales of about 30 billion pesetas , Zeta publishes over a dozen magazines , including the popular Tiempo , Interviu and Panorama , and three regional dailies .
capital.n | 1 | The quarterly results also reflected $ 21.4 million in non-recurring losses from commercial real-estate activities in California . Thomas Spiegel , Columbia 's chairman , said in a statement that the thrift was `` disappointed '' by the effects of the accounting changes . But he said Columbia remains `` one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry , '' based on the economic value of its assets and tangible %% capital %% . Columbia announced the results after the close of the stock market . Its shares closed at $ 5.125 each in composite New York Stock Exchange trading , down 37.5 cents .
capital.n | 1 | The stock 's decline accelerated in the past two weeks , from a price of $ 8 a share on Oct. 9 . Columbia officials said they do n't know how quickly they will dispose of the thrift 's junk bonds , because federal regulations , such as those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries , have n't yet been completed . Columbia officials also said the thrift should n't face problems meeting regulatory %% capital %% requirements , despite the large reserves and write-downs and stiffer regulatory requirements that should be in place by year 's end . Its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of Sept. 30 was 3.6 % , and total equity was $ 457.9 million . The thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs , which has a book value of $ 90 million .
capital.n | 1 | What that will mean for manufacturers is anybody 's guess . '' Campeau 's financial situation is complicated by an estimated $ 1.23 billion in debt due next spring . This includes a working %% capital %% facility for Allied Stores of $ 350 million that matures March 15 , 1990 , and an $ 800 million bridge loan due April 30 , 1990 . The company has stated in recently filed financial documents that it anticipates refinancing its March 1990 payments . In recent months , numerous retailers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , including Bonwit Teller , B. Altman & Co. , and Miller & Rhoads Inc .

The company said it expects to receive acceptances for its offer of 253 pence ( $ 4.05 ) per share representing at least 67 % of Ross Catherall 's issued share %% capital %% , or 12.7 million ordinary shares . Vickers said its offer also includes an option to receive a redeemable loan note in lieu of cash . The notes can be redeemed starting in July 1991 .
capital.n | 1 | HomeFed said the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the California market . Any such downturn in California would be grim news for West Coast thrifts , particularly the less healthy ones , which have performed poorly even with a torrid market . But HomeFed said it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new %% capital %% requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government 's massive thrift bailout bill . It said its real-estate operations earned a record $ 21.7 million , more than double year-earlier real estate profit of $ 9 million . And analysts said they see no signs of an imminent swoon in California real estate , even with last week 's earthquake .

capital.n | 1 | A slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend to bolster bond prices . On the surface , the decline in September durable goods -- only 0.1 % -- did n't appear very weak . But orders for non-defense %% capital %% goods , a precursor of future plant and equipment spending , were off 5.6 % after falling 10.3 % in August . Auto makers reported that mid-October sales were running at an annual rate of about 5.8 million units , far less than the 6.6 million units analysts had expected . Taken together , the auto-sales and durable-goods reports confirmed perceptions that the economy is bogging down .
capital.n | 1 | ( Secondary guarantees of pools of FHA - and VA-backed loans by the agency known as Ginnie Mae currently exceed $ 330 billion . ) Although external events have contributed to the morass , the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs . To reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide , credit policy must : 1 . Use credit to improve the operation of %% capital %% markets , not to provide subsidies . There is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program . If the program is meant to provide a subsidy , collecting the debt defeats the original goal .
capital.n | 1 | Thus , subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time . To avoid this problem , government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect . In contrast , credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of %% capital %% markets . For example , legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector . Farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds .
capital.n | 1 | She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . Orders for %% capital %% defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 . While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders .
capital.n | 1 | That is a little disturbing , '' Ms. Kleinman said . `` It also means if you have a real drop-off in orders , production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going . '' %% Capital %% goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row , posting a 5.6 % drop after a 10.3 % decline . Such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy . But a Commerce Department analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings , a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year .
capital.n | 1 | `` They are holding their own in a weak market , and the restructuring is working , '' he says . David T. Kearns , Xerox chairman and chief executive officer , cited the restructuring and `` strong '' cost controls for the 13 % growth in profit from business products and systems operations . Mr. Glazer expects Xerox to experience tough sledding , though , in financial services because of rate pressures and uncertainty surrounding tax treatment of %% capital %% gains . In the quarter , the Crum & Forster insurance unit reported $ 200 million before tax of capital gains from property and casualty operations . The subsidiary also increased reserves by $ 140 million , however , and set aside an additional $ 25 million for claims connected with Hurricane Hugo .

capital.n | 1 | The tougher new regulations under the savings-and-loan bailout law are accelerating the thrift industry 's shrinking act . Largely to meet tougher new %% capital %% requirements , thrifts reduced their assets $ 13.4 billion in August , by selling such assets as mortgage-backed securities and loans . Industry assets as of Aug. 31 were $ 1.31 trillion , the lowest since August 1988 . As thrifts sell assets to improve their capital-to-asset ratio , as required under the new law passed in August , they must also reduce liabilities , such as deposits .
capital.n | 1 | As thrifts sell assets to improve their capital-to-asset ratio , as required under the new law passed in August , they must also reduce liabilities , such as deposits . As interest rates paid depositors were lowered , thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 5.1 billion , not including interest credited to accounts . It was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed assets to increase the size of their %% capital %% in relation to their assets , the Office of Thrift Supervision said . The asset shrinkage was particularly concentrated in several large California institutions . `` The downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way , '' said Bert Ely , an industry consultant in Alexandria , Va .
capital.n | 1 | Not including thrifts under government conservatorship , S&Ls reduced their assets by $ 10.1 billion from the previous month , and deposit outflows totaled $ 3.9 billion . For the 264 insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of August , assets declined by $ 3.3 billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 1.2 billion . Thrifts raised %% capital %% mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities , which were reduced by $ 7.8 billion in August from the prior month . As of Aug. 31 , thrifts held $ 185 billion in mortgage-backed securities . The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $ 54 million -- the only net inflow in more than a year .
capital.n | 1 | A committee representing the unsecured creditors agreed to accept 24 cents on the dollar , Eagle said . The plan would extend the period under which Eagle has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan . It would extinguish all of Eagle 's existing %% capital %% stock and issue new stock to York as sole holder . A bankruptcy court hearing is set for Nov. 3 on these accords . In its bankruptcy-law petition , filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan , Eagle said its problems began in 1987 and early 1988 when its then-senior lender , Bankers Trust Co. , reduced its credit line .
capital.n | 1 | Those implications include : -- Privatization . Faced with a $ 40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation , Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance . Market-based pollution control may consume some %% capital %% that would otherwise purchase state industries . But it could also accelerate `` marketization '' by reinforcing industrial accountability , breaking up state monopolies , giving managers a stake in solutions , and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects . -- Least-cost solutions .

As conferees noted , scarce %% capital %% means the costs of control must be minimized through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms . That means simple , clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction , deferring more complex issues such as risk . It also means use of quantity-based pollution limits such as transferable permits , rather than price-based limits such as effluent fees .
capital.n | 1 | Earnings have rebounded in 1989 after a 20 % decline last year . A former executive agreed that the departures do n't reflect major problems , adding : `` If you see any company that grows as fast as Reebok did , it is going to have people coming and going . '' Reebok said Mr. LaBonte will resume the presidency of Vantage Group Inc. , a California-based venture %% capital %% firm that he founded in 1983 . Before that he was president and chief operating officer of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp . Reebok added that Mr. Fireman will assume the title of president .
capital.n | 1 | The United Kingdom carrier had planned the issue to help finance its $ 750 million purchase of a 15 % stake in UAL . But British Airways withdrew from the UAL labor-management buy-out plan last Friday , after the group failed to get bank financing for its $ 6.79 billion buy-out . British Airways said its shareholders accepted only 6.3 % of the convertible %% capital %% bonds , but that the rest of the issue will be taken up by underwriters . Analysts said that 6.3 % level marked the poorest showing for any major British rights issue since the 1987 global stock market crash . `` It is close to being a record undersubscription , '' said Bob Bucknell , an analyst with London broker Smith New Court Securities .
capital.n | 1 | In a statement , British Air Chairman Lord King said the company was `` obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up , but it would have been unreasonable to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue . '' But except for the embarrassment , British Air will emerge relatively unscathed from the flopped issue . Underwriters led by Lazard Brothers & Co. will pick up the rest of the airline 's offer of four convertible %% capital %% bonds for every nine common shares . Lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by sub-underwriting the issue among U.K. institutional investors . `` The ( paper ) loss here is very small '' for these sub-underwriters , observed John Nelson , a Lazard managing director .
capital.n | 1 | Exports reached $ 5.12 billion , up from $ 4.52 billion a year earlier , while imports rose to $ 6.81 billion from $ 5.33 billion . The trade deficit in the first eight months is already wider than the trade gap of $ 1.09 billion for all of 1988 . Analysts expect the trade gap for the year to surpass $ 2 billion as demand for %% capital %% equipment and raw materials continues to push imports higher .
capital.n | 1 | In addition , economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of China 's deteriorating political and economic environment . On top of all this , foreign-debt repayments are expected to peak in 1991 to 1992 . With less %% capital %% coming in , China 's balance of payments would suffer . The Western government report 's first scenario assumes a 30 % reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5 % contraction in foreign direct investment . In the second , foreign borrowing is projected to grow 10 % and investment to drop 10 % .
capital.n | 1 | Seeking to overcome the currency problems , Mr. Giffen 's American Trade Consortium , which comprises Chevron Corp. , RJR , Johnson & Johnson , Eastman Kodak Co. , and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , has concocted an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings , largely from the revenues of a planned Chevron oil project . Several medical concerns , including Pfizer Inc. , Hewlett-Packard Co. , Colgate and Abbott Laboratories intend to pursue a similar consortium approach . `` It 's hard to invest %% capital %% here on the same basis as investing in other countries , '' says Dennis A. Sokol , president of Medical Service Partners Inc. , who is putting the medical consortium together . Some U.S. entrepreneurs operate on a smaller scale . One group seeks to publish a U.S.-Soviet medical journal in conjunction with the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Health .

Time Warner reported a $ 176 million loss for the third quarter , reflecting the cost of the recent merger and a method of accounting for the deal . Thrifts continued to shed assets in August , mainly to comply with stiffer %% capital %% rules under the S&L bailout law . Also , withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 5.1 billion in the month . Exxon 's profit fell 9 % in the third quarter , hurt by sagging results at two of its three main businesses .
capital.n | 1 | Property Capital , which is based in Boston , had told shareholders it expected to distribute at least $ 21 a share , or $ 229 million , in a liquidation , based on an expected asset sale price of $ 290 million or more . The company said it did n't receive an offer it wanted to accept . As a result of dropping the liquidation plan , shareholders will have to treat dividends received this year as ordinary income or %% capital %% gains rather than as tax free returns of capital , the company said . The share repurchase will be funded mostly from borrowings .

capital.n | 1 | Under the proposed plan , the fund would also lend Santa Fe Pacific Realty $ 75 million in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the then-prevailing market price . The note would accrue interest at the rate of 13.5 % a year , which would be payable to the fund after five years , according to Stephen E. Roulac , a real estate consultant working for the fund . The purpose of the note is to provide added %% capital %% for the spun-off company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments , Mr. Roulac said . The spun-off concern `` clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio , '' he said . For the last year , Santa Fe Pacific has redirected its real estate operations toward longer-term development of its properties , hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio .

There are about $ 100 million of 7 % term bonds due 2009 , priced to yield 7.30 % , which is the issue 's high yield .
capital.n | 1 | There are also about $ 124 million of 6 1\/2 % bonds priced to yield 7.25 % in 2012 ; about $ 97 million of 6 % bonds priced to yield 7.20 % in 2014 ; and about $ 26.5 million of 5 % bonds priced to yield 7.15 % in 2016 . All of the term bonds are original issue discount bonds , according to the lead underwriter . The %% capital %% appreciation bonds are tentatively priced to yield to maturity from 7 % in 2001 to 7.10 % in 2003-2005 . The bonds are rated double-A by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor 's Corp .

capital.n | 1 | Undaunted , Mr. Dozen said that Daiwa 's goal is to build `` a high-technology oriented international organization with maybe some Japanese flavor to it . '' He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures , options , mortgaged-backed securities , computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions . Mr. Dozen said Daiwa 's strengths were its large %% capital %% base , its influential position in the Tokyo market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors . Mr. Dozen joined Daiwa upon his graduation from Kyoto University in 1959 . Like many young recruits in Japanese securities firms , he began his career peddling stock to individual investors .
capital.n | 1 | Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this company . The debt-rating concern cited the bank 's move into the Texas market , noting its profitability and %% capital %% adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance . Moody 's also said it raised its rating on the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank , now known as Bank One , Texas N.A. , reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the FDIC . Officials at the New York bank-holding company were n't available for comment on the debt-rating changes .
capital.n | 1 | And Beijing has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies , leaving many domestic buyers and export-oriented plants strapped for cash . Givaudan Far East Ltd. , a Swiss concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in China , typifies the problems . Last year 's retrenchment dried up the working %% capital %% of Chinese factories . The company 's sales flattened during 1989 's first half . The June killings magnified the problems .
capital.n | 2 | In national over-the-counter trading Friday , LIN shares rose 62.5 cents to close at $ 110.625 . Beijing lawmakers have called for jails to be built to house prostitutes and for severe punishment , including the death sentence , for anyone who induces or coerces women into prostitution . The official Xinhua News Agency said the municipal government was discussing a draft bill to give the %% capital %% its first anti-prostitution statutes . It quoted Liu Changyi , deputy director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau , as saying that there were many more people involved in prostitution now than in 1985 , when there were about 100 cases . Foreigners involved in prostitution will be punished according to the law , and those with sexually transmitted diseases will be expelled from the country , according to the regulations .

capital.n | 1 | Under the offer , shareholders can purchase one Enfield share at C$ 6.27 for each five shares held . In Toronto Stock Exchange trading Friday , Enfield closed at C$ 6.75 , down 37.5 cents . The holding company said the rights offering should reduce its C$ 171 million debt to `` more manageable levels '' before Dec. 31 and allow it to finance future investments with equity %% capital %% . At last report , Enfield had about 44.5 million shares outstanding .
capital.n | 1 | It also had $ 479.7 million of past-due loans ; its level of reserves against those was n't immediately available , though it is believed to be small . The rapid deterioration of the Arizona thrifts only adds to the ever-swelling cost of the government 's massive thrift bailout , officially estimated at about $ 166 billion . Together , the six government-controlled or essentially insolvent Arizona thrifts have tangible %% capital %% of a negative $ 1.5 billion , foreclosed property of $ 1.8 billion and pastdue loans of $ 1.63 billion . They have no reserves against the real estate , and their reserves against the loans are miniscule compared with the levels of reserves banks are moving to set up . The thrifts had a combined loss of $ 487.8 million in the second quarter .

Moreover , Mr. Shattuck and others said residential real estate , which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn , is beginning to comprise more and more of the foreclosures . And the generally frail condition of Arizona 's lenders means there is little %% capital %% available in the state to shore up the economy and slow down the slide . `` It 's reasonable to say there is not a solvent S&L in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low , '' said Mr. Jackson . `` We 're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end ... .

The coupon will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of 101 .
capital.n | 1 | The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $ 350 per leasable square foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ 200 . Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts area are doing almost as well . A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development %% capital %% , and insurability . Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices . Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents .
capital.n | 1 | Thus there is even more to the Vermont-Slauson Center than a good place to shop . This defensible commercial zone becomes , for the residents , a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible . The center improves the community image to outsiders as well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of %% capital %% and investment . An additional benefit is the creation of jobs . This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers .
capital.n | 1 | Profits are also plowed back into the community ; the non-profit Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp. receives 60 % of the profits from the Vermont-Slauson Center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community -- now running into the hundreds of units -- as well as commercial and industrial development projects . Bradford Crowe , director of the mayor 's City Economic Development Office , says : `` There is no question that Vermont-Slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood . What had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock , thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization %% capital %% that Vermont-Slauson yields . '' Another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women . In the Grand Boulevard Plaza developed by Matanky Realty Group in Chicago 's Third Ward , opposite the Robert Taylor Homes , 29 % of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and 14 % to members of other minority groups .
capital.n | 2 | Mutinies wrack his armed forces ( really just an armed gang ) , which control less than half the country . Inflation is at record levels . Desperate , he has called in the Libyans to help fight the rebels of the Somali National Movement in the north , which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the %% capital %% of Mogadishu . Seventy years old and a self-declared `` scientific socialist , '' President Barre has a power base , composed only of his minority Mareham clan , that according to observers is `` narrowing . '' The U.S. 's interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera , which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean .
capital.n | 2 | Recently , in Wollo province in the center of Ethiopia , Tigrean forces have killed , wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops . ( Think what these numbers mean -- considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in Lebanon , a small country of little strategic importance ! ) Tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of Addis Ababa , threatening the town of Dese , which would cut off Mr. Mengistu 's %% capital %% from the port of Assab , through which all fuel and other supplies reach Addis Ababa . As a result , Mr. Mengistu has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from Eritrea just to hold the town , thereby risking the loss of even more territory in Eritrea only to keep the Tigreans at bay . Mr. Mengistu is in an increasingly weak position : Half his army is tied down defending the northern city of Asmara from the Eritreans .
capital.n | 1 | Mr. Evans had been the de facto head of MGM\/UA for months . Qintex Entertainment , a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its co-production of the hit miniseries `` Lonesome Dove , '' said it filed for Chapter 11 protection after Qintex Australia failed to provide it with $ 5.9 million owed to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of `` The New Leave It to Beaver Show . '' Qintex Entertainment is 43 % owned by Qintex Australia and said it relies on the Australian company for funding its working %% capital %% requirements . After the announcement of the bankruptcy filing , Qintex Entertainment stock sank $ 2.625 in over-the-counter trading to close at $ 1.50 on heavy volume of more than 1.4 million shares . The stock traded as high as $ 10 this past summer .
capital.n | 1 | Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail , but they can make life miserable in other ways -- for one , by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence , failure to file a return , and the like . The targeted audit groups include direct sellers -- people who sell cosmetics , housewares and other items door to door or at home parties -- and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees , to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes . Other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips , people who engage in large cash transactions , and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the %% capital %% gain in another home by the end of the same year ; the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax . And now that returns must show dependents ' Social Security numbers , the IRS wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return -- and which dependents turn out to be deceased . Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back .
capital.n | 2 | Welcome to that welter of contradictions known as Newport Beach . This city of more than 70,000 is known for sunshine , yachts and rich residents . It is also known as the fraud %% capital %% of the U.S. , dubbed by investigators and the media as the `` Cote de Fraud '' . How does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for low-lifes ? Clearly , the existence of the former lures the latter .
capital.n | 1 | The Tax Reform Act of 1986 , which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners , and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand , and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business . But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners ( IAFP ) , the industry 's biggest trade group , is still nearly triple what it was in 1980 , and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well . An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners , and the pool of %% capital %% they influence is enormous . A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $ 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months . The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult , if not impossible , to regulate .
capital.n | 1 | THROUGHOUT THE 1980s , investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning . %% Capital %% has been democratized , and people want in . Too often , however , small investors are left with the same stale solutions that appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists . Now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without undue risk , without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit !

Authorities in Honduras launched an investigation into the cause of Saturday 's crash of a Honduran jetliner that killed 132 of the 146 people aboard . The Boeing 727 , en route to Honduras from Costa Rica via Nicaragua , smashed into the hills outside Tegucigalpa as it approached the %% capital %% 's airport in high winds and low clouds . The U.S. and Israel have been holding what an aide to Prime Minister Shamir called intense telephone negotiations in an effort to bridge differences over Mideast peace moves .

Weirton , of Weirton , W. Va. , said $ 60.3 million of the proceeds were used to prepay the remaining amounts on the note outstanding to National Intergroup Inc. , the parent of National Steel . Remaining proceeds were used to pay other debt and to finance the company 's %% capital %% spending program .
capital.n | 1 | The board of this Ponce , Puerto Rico concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter . The third-largest thrift institution in Puerto Rico also said it expects a return to profitability in the third quarter when it reports operating results this week . Ponce Federal said the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent %% capital %% requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery , and Enforcement Act of 1989 .
capital.n | 1 | Eagle Financial Corp. and Webster Financial Corp. , two Connecticut savings bank-holding companies , agreed to merge in a tax-free stock transaction . The new holding company , Webster\/Eagle Bancorp Inc. , will have about $ 1.2 billion of assets and 19 banking offices in Connecticut . Tangible %% capital %% will be about $ 115 million . The merger is subject to regulatory clearance and a definitive agreement . In the merger , each share of Webster , based in Waterbury , will be converted into one share of the new company .
capital.n | 1 | As it stands now , the government would continue to hold 45 % of Picop after the 36 % stake is sold . ( About 7.5 % of Picop is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity . ) Potential buyers , mostly foreign companies , are reluctant to take a non-controlling stake in a company that , by the government 's own reckoning , needs some $ 100 million in new %% capital %% for rehabilitation . The prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers , including a member of the Elders group of Australia , to pull out of the bidding , the bankers and analysts say . Mr. Garcia acknowledges the problem and says the Asset Trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer .
capital.n | 1 | Edward J. Campbell , economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. , New York , noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas . Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group , Providence , R.I. , expects the deflator to rise 3.7 % , well below the second quarter 's 4.6 % , partly because of what he believes will be temporarily better price behavior . He expects real GNP growth of only 2.1 % for the quarter , noting a wider trade deficit , slower %% capital %% and government spending and the lower inventory figures . Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis , holds that the recent stock-market volatility `` increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news '' from recent trade deficit , employment and housing reports . The consensus calls for a 0.5 % increase in September personal income and a 0.3 % gain in consumption .

capital.n | 2 | William Bennett , the White House drug-policy director , accused local officials in the Washington area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers . `` Politics has essentially put up a roadblock '' to finding sites for new federal prisons , Mr. Bennett said at a news conference called to report on his `` emergency assistance program '' for the %% capital %% . Without more space to incarcerate convicted criminals , he added , `` we will not win the war on drugs . '' Mr. Bennett declared in April that he would make Washington a `` test case '' for how the Bush administration would aid cities afflicted by heavy drug trafficking and violence .
capital.n | 2 | But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state . Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city . In a letter to Mr. Bennett 's office , released yesterday , Washington 's city administrator , Carol Thompson , complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the %% capital %% . Referring to Mr. Bennett 's claim that the federal government would provide $ 97 million in emergency federal support , Ms. Thompson wrote , `` Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure . '' Of his successes in Washington , Mr. Bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates .

He is under intense fire from other Palestinian groups ; Syria is pushing Ahmad Jibril , whose terrorist band is blamed for the Pan Am 103 bombing , as an alternative to Arafat . DARMAN'S MANEUVERS on the budget and %% capital %% gains hurt him in Congress . Republicans as well as Democrats were angered by the budget director 's rejection of Speaker Foley 's effort to expedite a deficitcutting measure by stripping it of the capital-gains tax cut as well as pet Democratic projects . Darman now blames the clash on miscommunication , but House GOP leader Michel , who carried the offer to him , observes , `` I was speaking English at the time , and quite loud so I could be understood .

capital.n | 1 | Sales dropped 6 % to $ 2.58 billion from $ 2.74 billion , reflecting eight fewer business days in the latest quarter . The company , which is in a costly modernization program , said earnings were hurt by higher start-up and new program costs , increased costs of materials , higher wages and an $ 11 million provision for bad debts in Latin America . In announcing a 1989 %% capital %% spending plan of $ 950 million early this year , Caterpillar said full-year earnings would be flat compared with last year 's $ 616 million , or $ 6.07 a share . But yesterday , the company said this year 's profit will be lower . It did n't say by how much .
capital.n | 1 | `` Everything is up for grabs , '' says Theodore Groom , a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies . Adds Robert Juliano , the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses : `` It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again . '' The catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for %% capital %% gains , an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress . Other fundamental `` reforms '' of the 1986 act have been threatened as well . The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes .

Even lobbyists for heavy industry , one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill , are encouraged . The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for %% capital %% gains and IRAs `` creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation ( write-offs ) or investment credits , '' says Paul Huard , a vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers . Corporate lobbyist Charls Walker is planning a spring conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve `` competitiveness . '' In reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation , groups are lobbying to make sure they are n't left off the gravy train .
capital.n | 1 | In reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation , groups are lobbying to make sure they are n't left off the gravy train . Real-estate interests , for example , are protesting an omission in President Bush 's capital-gains proposal : It does n't include real-estate gains . `` If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of %% capital %% gains , they certainly want to be part of it , '' says real-estate lobbyist Wayne Thevenot of Concord Associates . In the House-passed tax bill , Mr. Thevenot got his wish ; real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision . But Sotheby 's , Christie 's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs .
capital.n | 1 | But Sotheby 's , Christie 's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs . They have sent a letter to congressional tax-writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment . `` Collectibles should continue to be recognized as %% capital %% assets , '' the letter states . All of this talk is antithetical to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 . In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates , the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions , deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others .
capital.n | 1 | In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates , the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions , deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others . The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally , and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes . Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of %% capital %% gains and to curtail the use of paper losses , also known as passive losses , that made many tax shelters possible . Many other tax benefits also were swept away . This year Congress , with prodding from President Bush , has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code .
capital.n | 1 | But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing , some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy . Some analysts believe China soon will begin relaxing economic controls , particularly by loosening credit . That would benefit Chinese enterprises as well as Sino-foreign joint ventures , both of which have been plagued by shortages of working %% capital %% . A dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in inter-company debts threatens , if unchecked , to bring the economy to a collapse . One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of People 's Bank of China , the central bank , to allocate $ 5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest , the official China Daily reported .
capital.n | 3 | Investors , for instance , may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities . It is n't .

capital.n | 1 | The president apparently will have only one bill to push , Sen. Packwood 's , and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it . `` I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor , '' said Sen. David Boren ( D. , Okla. ) , a leader of those Democrats . The Packwood plan , as expected , would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a %% capital %% asset held for more than one year . The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held , until it reached a maximum of 35 % after seven years . The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 .
capital.n | 1 | Market makers buy what investors wish to sell ; their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors , and at a profit . As a result , while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker ( which is micro-liquidity for the investor ) , the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction : The unwanted position is still an unwanted position ; only the identity of the seller has changed . In fact it can be argued that increasing %% capital %% commitments by market makers ( a result of some post-1987 crash studies ) also increases market volatility , since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time , the more selling pressure is overhanging the market . In an open electronic system , any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve ( buy and sell orders at each price ) entered by dealers and investors alike , and to enter and execute orders . Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants -- not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis .
capital.n | 1 | Speaking to reporters this week after Bank Bumiputra 's shareholders approved a rescue plan , Tan Sri Basir said heavy lending to the property sector rocked the bank when property prices in Malaysia plummeted in 1984-85 . He said the bank could n't wait any longer for prices to recover and for borrowers to service their loans . So the bank 's board decided to make 1.23 billion Malaysian dollars ( US$ 457 million ) in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the bank , and to submit a bailout package to replenish the bank 's paid-up %% capital %% . The predicament , he added , was similar to the Hong Kong 1982-83 property-price collapse , which exposed the involvement of Bank Bumiputra 's former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in Malaysia 's history . The subsidiary , Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd. , was left with M$ 2.26 billion in bad loans made to Hong Kong property speculators .

In five years , Petronas , which became the dominant shareholder in a 1984 rescue exercise , has spent about M$ 3.5 billion to prop up the troubled bank . Tan Sri Basir said the %% capital %% restructuring plan has been approved by Malaysia 's Capital Issues Committee and central bank . Malaysia 's High Court is expected to approve the plan . Once the plan is approved , Tan Sri Basir said , most of Bank Bumiputra 's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between M$ 160 million and M$ 170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31 .

At the end of the exercise , the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank 's paid-up capital to M$ 1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions .

'' The company estimated that the transaction would enhance its book value , which stood at $ 28.55 a share on Sept. 30 , by more than $ 100 million , or about $ 4 a share . The company also said the transaction would bolster after-tax earnings by $ 3.25 a share when completed and boost its primary %% capital %% ratio to 7 % from 6.63 % . First City , which recently purchased three small Texas banking concerns , said it would use the proceeds to pursue additional expansion opportunities in the Southwest and elsewhere . With that possibility in mind , analysts said the transaction was a positive move for First City .
capital.n | 1 | The 61-year-old Mr. Guzman Cabrera takes such criticisms in stride . `` This is n't a new kind of union leadership , it 's a new Mexico . We 're no longer afraid of associating with private or foreign %% capital %% , '' he says . Pemex , which produces 40 % of government revenue , desperately needs new investment . Since world oil prices collapsed in 1982 , the government has siphoned Pemex 's coffers to make payments on Mexico 's $ 97 billion foreign debt .
capital.n | 1 | The new contract also eliminates the $ 15 monthly coupon , good only at union-owned grocery stores , that was part of the salary of every worker , from roughneck to chief executive . About 9,800 technical workers , notably chemists and lawyers , were switched to non-union status . Also , because of its reduced %% capital %% budget , Pemex has phased out about 50,000 transitory construction workers , reducing the work force to about 140,000 , the union leader says . Mr. Guzman Cabrera says the union 's sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22 % increase in compensation . But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract .
capital.n | 2 | Argentina and Britain agreed to resume diplomatic and economic relations , seven years after the two nations battled over the Falkland Islands . The announcement , in which they said hostilities had ceased , followed a two-day meeting in Madrid . Rebel artillerists bombarded the %% capital %% of Afghanistan , killing at least 12 people , as the Soviet Union was reported to be airlifting arms and food to Kabul 's forces . Fighting also was reported around the strategic town of Khost , near the Pakistani border . Saudi Arabia 's foreign minister met in Damascus with President Assad to develop a plan for the withdrawal of Syria 's 40,000 troops from Lebanon as part of a settlement of that nation 's 14-year-old civil war .
capital.n | 1 | Lonrho PLC of Britain is to come to the rescue of the French distribution group Societe Commerciale de l'Ouest Africaine in an operation that has been engineered with the Paribas financial group , Societe Commerciale 's main shareholder . The announcement came as Societe Commerciale , a trading company with activities in more than 40 countries , reported a loss of 320.5 million francs ( $ 51 million ) for the first six months of this year , partly because of provisions on future losses . The rescue operation will consist of a %% capital %% boost for Societe Commerciale of one billion francs through issues of new shares and convertible bonds . Cie . Financiere de Paribas said it intends to transfer its 30 % shareholding in Societe Commerciale to a new company which will be jointly owned with Lonrho . This will give Paribas and Lonrho joint control of Societe Commerciale .

capital.n | 2 | Apparently so . There are no easy choices in Cambodia , but we ca n't imagine that it benefits the U.S. to become the catalyst for an all-too-familiar process that could end in another round of horror in Cambodia . Now that Vietnam appears to have pulled out its occupation army , the State Department is talking again about accepting an `` interim '' coalition government in the Cambodian %% capital %% of Phnom Penh . The coalition would include the current Vietnamese-backed Hun Sen regime , the two non-communist resistance groups led by Son Sann and Prince Sihanouk , and the Khmer Rouge . The aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of Cambodia by allowing the Khmer Rouge a small share of power .

Florio Fiorini , managing director of Geneva-based Sasea , said the investors would pay only a symbolic one lira for the station , `` but we have agreed to raise the %% capital %% that will enable the company to continue operating . It 's sort of a Chapter 11 situation , '' he added , referring to the U.S. bankruptcy law that protects companies from creditors while they restructure . Milan-based Odeon , which draws about 3 % of Italian TV viewers , has debt of 250 billion lire ( $ 181.9 million ) , Mr. Fiorini said .
capital.n | 2 | Also , the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage . The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance , so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows , falling brick and cornices , buckled asphalt or sidewalks . Of course , the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation 's %% capital %% of high technology . Like other major American cities , the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors . When the tremors struck , the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air .
capital.n | 1 | He gave 10-to-1 odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year , though it probably wo n't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill . He added that he expects to talk to the Democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal . For individuals , the Packwood plan would exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a %% capital %% asset held for more than one year . The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35 % . The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 , 1989 .

capital.n | 1 | That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman 's Fund Corp. , based in Novato , Calif. , and Cigna Corp. , based in Philadelphia . Earthquake-related claims are n't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole . Instead , even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks , analysts said the total %% capital %% of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear . Indeed , the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways . For example , insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy .
capital.n | 1 | Timothy Vincent , Petco chief executive officer , confirmed that Petco was withdrawing from the clearing business . `` The owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business , and after Monday they felt they did n't want to be exposed any more , '' he said . He added that Petco remained in compliance with all industry %% capital %% requirements during the market 's rapid plunge Friday and Monday 's rebound . A CBOE spokeswoman declined comment on Petco . Over the weekend Fossett Corp. , another options trading firm , transferred the clearing accounts of about 160 traders to First Options of Chicago , a unit of Continental Bank Corp. , because it could n't meet regulatory capital requirements after Friday 's market slide .

The unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry 's desire not to have its credibility tarnished by potentially widespread trading defaults on Monday . The CBOE , American Stock Exchange , Options Clearing Corp. and Stephen Fossett , owner of Fossett , joined in putting up $ 50 million to guarantee the accounts at First Options .
capital.n | 1 | Officials at the four exchanges said well over 50 traders from the Pacific exchange were taking flights from San Francisco late yesterday to the American , New York and Philadelphia exchanges and to the CBOE , where they would continue making markets in the Pacific-listed options . The Big Board said carpenters quickly erected a new options floor to accomodate 40 traders from the Pacific exchange . In addition , specialists on the exchanges agreed to provide backup %% capital %% for market-making in Pacific exchange options traded on the exchanges . Trading was light on the Pacific Stock Exchange yesterday , with workers at the exchange 's main floor in San Francisco struggling to execute orders by flashlight as a result of a continuing power outage . The most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading .
capital.n | 1 | And by the early 1980s U.S. capitalists had ample reason to welcome junk bonds , to look the other way . By that time they found extremely low profit rates from non-financial corporate investment . Government statistics in fact show that the profit rate -- net pretax profits divided by %% capital %% stock -- peaked in 1965 at 17.2 % . That same calculation saw profit rates fall to 4.6 % in the recession year 1982 and the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1 % in 1986 and 8 % in 1987 . Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was -- in the early 1980s -- the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets , the famous Q ratio associated with Prof. James Tobin .
capital.n | 1 | Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was -- in the early 1980s -- the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets , the famous Q ratio associated with Prof. James Tobin . In theory , the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same . But of course the market could decide that the firm 's %% capital %% stock -- its assets -- means nothing if the firm is not producing profits . This is indeed what the market decided . By 1982 the ratio was 43.5 % , meaning that the market was valuing every dollar 's worth of the average firm 's assets at 43 cents .
capital.n | 1 | This is indeed what the market decided . By 1982 the ratio was 43.5 % , meaning that the market was valuing every dollar 's worth of the average firm 's assets at 43 cents . From the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes only 43 cents to buy a dollar 's worth of a firm 's %% capital %% stock , an alert entrepreneur wo n't look the other way . His assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits , thus restoring the market 's faith in them . Hence the LBO craze .

capital.n | 1 | Without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits , they look to the government , which obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or bailouts . The consequence can be inflation , brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the deflationary shock of a sudden crash . Attacks on inflation come with another strategy of %% capital %% of a very traditional sort : an assault on wages . Mr. Fukuyama , peering through binoculars at the end of history , said in his essay that `` the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the West ... the egalitarianism of modern America represents the essential achievement of the classless society envisioned by Marx . ''
capital.n | 1 | Some funds are posting yields far higher than the average . The highest yielding taxable fund this week was Harbor Money Market Fund , with a seven-day compound yield of 12.75 % . That included %% capital %% gains that were passed along to customers . Among the other high-yielding funds , Fidelity 's Spartan Fund had a seven-day compound yield of 9.33 % in the latest week . The seven-day compound yield of the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Fund was 9.51 % .

capital.n | 1 | The software conversion costs would dwarf any savings . '' But Mr. Rose is still looking seriously at the 9000 . Bankers Trust uses Digital 's VAX to run its huge money-transfer and %% capital %% markets accounts , juggling hundreds of billions of dollars each day , he says . As that system grows , larger computers may be needed . `` In the past , customers had to go to IBM when they outgrew the VAX .
capital.n | 1 | Not only was August 's deficit far worse than July 's , but the government revised the July figure substantially from the $ 7.58 billion deficit it had initially reported last month . Many economists contend that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur . That 's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign %% capital %% , overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export . `` People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits , but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem , '' said Mr. Robertson . In addition , the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness .

The bonds are insured and rated triple-A by Moody 's and S&P . Connecticut -- $ 100.4 million of general obligation %% capital %% appreciation bonds , College Savings Plan , 1989 Series B , priced by a Prudential-Bache Capital Funding group . The zero-coupon bonds were priced to yield to maturity from 6.25 % in 1994 to 6.90 % in 2006 , 2007 and 2009 . The bonds have received a rating of double-A-1 from Moody 's , and a double-A-plus rating is expected from S&P , the underwriter said .
capital.n | 1 | As a result , he took the lead in arguing that the cut should be blocked on procedural grounds . He helped persuade 10 of these senators to support him and Majority Leader George Mitchell on these grounds . The budget reconciliation had to be dealt with by the Oct. 15 deadline , and these Senate Democrats refused to agree to allow a vote to append %% capital %% gains to the budget bill , knowing it would pass . Denied a vote on substance , the GOP leadership in the Senate on Friday morning was confronted with a hard choice . It could throw in the towel and hope to win on capital gains late this month , or it could follow the White House strategy , to veto reconciliation unless capital gains was appended .

The stock market reacted as Mr. Rahn did , crumbling as it absorbed the news that Mr. Darman 's strategy had been abandoned . The stock market , after all , represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation 's %% capital %% stock , discounted to present value . Why should it be so surprising that a 30 % cut in the capital-gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the value of the nation 's capital stock ? The total value of privately held assets is easily more than $ 15 trillion .

Indeed , the stock market 's steady advance this year tracked with President Bush 's success in advancing his capital-gains proposal . A 30 % cut in this year 's %% capital %% gains alone amounts to roughly $ 50 billion . We 're talking real money .

capital.n | 1 | Sen. Bradley 's argument is that a capital-gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run . It would inevitably lead to an increase in marginal income-tax rates in 1990 , he thinks , when the White House is forced to ask for higher taxes to meet budget targets . That is , with %% capital %% gains cut , the glue of the 1986 accord will be gone , and political realities will push up income-tax rates . The counter-argument , which he has heard , is that if he and his fellow Democrats are successful in killing the president 's proposal , the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy . In this atmosphere , there would be no serious consideration of tax increases .

But according to Great American , such profits do n't count toward meeting the San Diego savings bank 's new capitalization requirements under 1989 federal law . The new real estate unit would have a separate %% capital %% structure to comply with the law . The proposed holding company would also consolidate Great American Bank in San Diego and its Tucson , Ariz. , savings bank into a single , federally chartered institution in San Diego . The consolidation is expected to save $ 1 million a year in administrative costs , a Great American spokesman said .
capital.n | 1 | The Paris-based group said its earlier projection -- that group profit for all of 1989 would be close to the 322.7 million francs posted for 1988 -- remains valid . Taking into account nonrecurring gains and losses , Hachette 's group net income for the first six months of this year totaled 246.6 million francs , practically double the year-earlier figure of 124.5 million francs . Analysts said Hachette 's earnings in the second half might be boosted by a %% capital %% gain from the sale of the Paris headquarters of a newspaper-delivery company that is 49 % owned by Hachette .

The Fed arranged $ 1.5 billion of customer repurchase agreements Tuesday , the second repurchase agreement in two days . The move , which injects %% capital %% into the system , is seen as an effort to reassure the finanicial markets that the U.S. central bank is ready to provide the ample liquidity . But other analysts contend that while the Fed 's move to loosen credit has n't been aggressive , it nevertheless sends a clear signal that , at least for now , the Fed has relaxed its grip on credit . They add that the Fed has allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5\/8 % from its levels of just below 9 % last week .
capital.n | 1 | Conservatives have an important decision to make this fall . At the recent meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund , the Bush administration announced its intention to decide by yearend the size of the next increase in the IMF 's %% capital %% base . While the U.S. share of the increase probably will not reach the $ 12 billion or more implicit in the IMF 's request for a doubling of its $ 90 billion capital , the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase . This would be consistent with its unwavering support for the Brady Plan and G-7 exchange-rate intervention , and with its financial commitment to Mexico , Poland and others .

capital.n | 1 | Its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the 1970s . The size and pace of disbursements will accelerate further under the Brady Plan , which promises larger and earlier disbursements to approved countries . At least three other factors have encouraged the IMF to insist on increased %% capital %% . First , it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets , for which it feels some responsibility . Second , the World Bank 's recent $ 75 billion capital increase -- $ 14 billion from the U.S. -- has left the IMF feeling less than first fiddle among international financial institutions .

Opponents of the increase argue that the IMF practices central planning while supporting ineffective governments . They question whether the IMF has any role in developing countries , given its original mandate to assist industrial countries in balance-of-payments emergencies .

They point at the numerous developing-country governments that have inflated , taxed and regulated themselves into despair under successive IMF programs . Decisions on increases in the IMF 's %% capital %% base traditionally are made by the administration , with subsequent authorization by Congress . The last U.S. congressional authorization , in 1983 , was a political donnybrook and carried a $ 6 billion housing program along with it to secure adequate votes . The politics of the 1990 congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous authorizations .
capital.n | 1 | Liberals may support the stabilizing , quasi-governmental role of the IMF on two conditions : that the administration give assurances that liberal Democrats ' support will not be used against them in congressional re-election campaigns ; and that the legislation address -- with dollars -- social and environmental concerns . Conservative Republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party 's popular president in an election year . A U.S. decision to refuse the IMF its %% capital %% increase , or limit it to 25 % , would bring a major change in international economic policy , and could not be taken lightly . Commentators would fret over the implications for the G-7 coordination process and the stability of world financial markets . Because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase , a scaled-down IMF mission would leave both feeling shortchanged .

On the other hand , a decision to increase the IMF 's capital would reinforce the central economic role of multilateral institutions in developing countries .

capital.n | 1 | Upping the ante could slow economic development even further , as countries delay market-opening steps in anticipation of richer multilateral support . Conservatives should take a position prior to the administration 's year-end deadline . The issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the %% capital %% increase , rather than its purpose . If conservatives do n't support an increase in the IMF 's capital , then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative . Mr. Malpass directs the Republican staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress .

capital.n | 1 | Wall Street traders say that , with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the 1970s , securities firms ca n't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock . `` I think everyone 's a little more leery , '' says Jack Baker , head of equity trading at Shearon Lehman Hutton Inc . `` The institutions have driven ( commission ) rates down to the point where it makes no sense to commit %% capital %% , '' says Tom Gallagher , senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at Oppenheimer & Co . `` Why should I risk money for a guy for who 's paying me five cents a dance ? All you get is risk . ''
capital.n | 1 | Underwriters led by PaineWebber Inc. set preliminary pricing for $ 144.4 million of California Health Facilities Financing Authority revenue bonds for Kaiser Permanente . Tentative reoffering yields were set from 6.25 % in 1993 to 7.227 % in 2018 . As part of its College Savings Plan , Connecticut offered $ 100.4 million of general obligation %% capital %% appreciation bonds priced to yield to maturity from 6.25 % in 1994 to 6.90 % in 2006 , 2007 and 2009 . A Chemical Securities group won a $ 100 million Oregon general obligation veterans ' tax note issue due Nov. 1 , 1990 . The 6 3\/4 % notes yield 6.25 % .
capital.n | 1 | Unknown before 1960 were the inconclusive effects of acid rain , greenhouse warming and ozone depletion , all of which required burgeoning political power and gargantuan expense . Meanwhile , the New Environmentalists systematically opposed the methods of the Old Environmentalists . Local pollution problems require cheap energy and %% capital %% for their solution . But the New Environmentalists oppose private wealth creation ( which , they claim , depletes natural resources ) and nuclear power ( even though it would counteract the greenhouse effect ) . They are in the forefront of opposing the search for new landfills and methods of incineration and even oppose new methods of research such as genetic engineering .
capital.n | 1 | Industrial production declined 0.1 % in September , reinforcing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend . The Federal Reserve Board said output of the nation 's factories , mines and utilities expanded at an annual rate of 1.3 % in the third quarter , substantially slower than the 3.3 % annual rate in the second quarter . `` %% Capital %% spending and exports , which have been the driving force in this expansion , are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them , '' said Robert Dederick , economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago . The new reports of sluggishness , which were foreshadowed by an earlier Labor Department report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by 105,000 in September , give the Fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates . `` They need to do something about this , '' said Maury Harris , economist at PaineWebber Group Inc .
capital.n | 1 | Production of factory equipment , one indication of the strength of manufacturers ' investment spending , fell 0.3 % . Some economists expect further declines in investment spending . `` Whenever corporate profits are weak that means %% capital %% spending is going to soften subsequently , '' Mr. Harris said . `` You have n't seen the full effect of that yet . '' A decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto assemblies , the Fed noted .
capital.n | 2 | `` He did it very well , '' recalls Boris Martinez , a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation . `` He started building the files that helped him gain power . '' A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City , %% capital %% of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy . By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information . He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk , which had been found with their mistresses .
capital.n | 2 | But Mr. Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House would n't act against him , recalls his close ally Jose Blandon , because he had an insurance policy : his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua . Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama . Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan %% capital %% of Managua . And on at least one occasion , in the spring of 1985 , he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua . Although , his help for the Contra cause was limited , it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration , says Sen. Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat who then served on the Senate Intelligence Committee .
capital.n | 1 | The damage was so bad at Fossett Corp. , an options trading firm here , that it was forced to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago , a unit of Continental Bank Corp. , as a result of options trading losses . Fosset so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of Friday 's rout . Fossett still had several million dollars in %% capital %% left after Friday 's close of trading , but not enough that regulators , worried about another potential market plunge yesterday , would let it reopen for trading , options exchange officials said . Thus , in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer , the CBOE , the American Stock Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp. , as well as the firm 's owner , Stephen Fossett , put up a total of $ 50 million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday . S. Waite Rawls III , vice chairman of Continental Bank , First Options ' parent company , said the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held by Fossett , almost all of them belonging to professional floor traders .
capital.n | 1 | Business , however , continues to be `` robust , '' and the stock market has n't affected the concern 's expansion plans , says Todd Krasnow , a senior executive . Other companies figure they ca n't avoid the market . `` We have %% capital %% requirements , '' says Mr. Linsert , `` so we have to go ahead '' with a planned $ 1.5 billion private placement . Unless the market goes right back up , he says , `` it may take us six to nine months to find the money , instead of three . '' And the Columbia , Md. , company may have to settle for a lower price , he adds .
capital.n | 1 | As of late yesterday , the IPO was still on . For many , the situation is especially discouraging because the market for IPOs was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness . `` We were just beginning to look at the increase in IPOs , seeing the light at the end of the tunnel , '' says Frank Kline Jr. , partner in Lambda Funds , a Beverly Hills , Calif. , venture %% capital %% concern . `` But the tunnel 's just gotten longer . '' Companies planning to go public `` are definitely taking a second look , '' says Allen Hadhazy , senior analyst at the Institute for Econometric Research , Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , which publishes the New Issues newsletter on IPOs .

Panny , MLX chairman and chief executive , said the pact `` will provide MLX with the additional time and flexibility necessary to complete the restructuring of the company 's %% capital %% structure . '' MLX has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering a proposed offering of $ 120 million in long-term senior subordinated notes and warrants .
capital.n | 1 | `` It 's called bad money driving out good money , '' said one retailing observer . `` Institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned . '' However , the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary %% capital %% and pay back the resulting debt . In addition , the fall selling season has generally been a good one , especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues . `` What 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings , not liquidation values , '' said Joseph E. Brooks , chairman and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor Inc. , a specialty chain .
capital.n | 1 | This Los Angeles company and its Union Federal Savings Bank subsidiary said more than 99 % of their 7 1\/4 % convertible subordinated debentures due 2011 were tendered for conversion into UnionFed common stock . The conversion increased total equity %% capital %% by about $ 38.5 million to a total of $ 156.8 million . Union Federal , a federally insured savings bank , has $ 2.4 billion in assets .
