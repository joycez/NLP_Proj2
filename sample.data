capital.n | 2 | `` He did it very well , '' recalls Boris Martinez , a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation . `` He started building the files that helped him gain power . '' A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City , %% capital %% of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy . By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information . He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk , which had been found with their mistresses .

Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama . Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan %% capital %% of Managua . And on at least one occasion , in the spring of 1985 , he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua .

capital.n | 1 | The damage was so bad at Fossett Corp. , an options trading firm here , that it was forced to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago , a unit of Continental Bank Corp. , as a result of options trading losses . Fosset so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of Friday 's rout . Fossett still had several million dollars in %% capital %% left after Friday 's close of trading , but not enough that regulators , worried about another potential market plunge yesterday , would let it reopen for trading , options exchange officials said . Thus , in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer , the CBOE , the American Stock Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp. , as well as the firm 's owner , Stephen Fossett , put up a total of $ 50 million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday . S. Waite Rawls III , vice chairman of Continental Bank , First Options ' parent company , said the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held by Fossett , almost all of them belonging to professional floor traders .
